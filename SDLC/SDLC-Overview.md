# SDLC: Software Development Life Cycle 📈

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a `structured process` used for developing software applications. This methodical approach ensures that software is built efficiently and meets user requirements.

SDLC typically involves a series of `phases`, which I'll discuss below, to ensure that software is developed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards.

## Why SDLC? 🤔

`SDLC` is essential in software development as it helps teams deliver high-quality software products on time, within budget, and with minimal errors. It provides a framework for managing and controlling the development process, ensuring that the final product meets the required standards and user expectations.

## Phases of SDLC 📅

The `SDLC` process consists of seven distinct `phases` that help ensure software development is done efficiently and effectively. Let's see what the phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) are all about:

### 1. Planning 📝

In this phase, we determine the project's goals, scope, and feasibility. This phase sets the foundation for the entire project, so it's crucial to get it right.

**Example:** Project managers define the project objectives and decide whether the project is feasible.

### 2. Requirements Analysis 🔍

Here, we gather and analyze user requirements to ensure the software will meet user needs.

**Example:** Business analysts gather detailed requirements from stakeholders and document them.

### 3. Design 🖌️

This phase involves creating architectural and detailed designs. These designs serve as blueprints for the development team.

**Example:** Architects and developers create system designs and detailed specifications.

### 4. Implementation (Coding) 💻

Now, it's time to write and compile the code. Developers must adhere to the design specifications to ensure the code meets the required standards.

**Example:** Developers start writing code based on the design documents.

### 5. Testing 🧪

We verify that the software works as intended in this phase. This helps catch and fix any bugs or issues before deployment.

**Example:** Testers run various tests to ensure the software is bug-free and meets requirements.

### 6. Deployment 🚀

Deploying the software to the production environment happens here. This makes the software available for users.

**Example:** The software is deployed to production and made available to users.

### 7. Maintenance 🔧

Finally, we perform updates and bug fixes post-deployment. This ensures the software continues to function properly and remains up-to-date.

**Example:** Ongoing maintenance and support ensure the software continues to function properly.
