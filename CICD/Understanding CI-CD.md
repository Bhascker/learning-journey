# Hello, everyone! 👋

Today, I'm sharing a simplified guide to CI/CD, covering the essentials of `Continuous Integration` and `Continuous Deployment`. But, there's more to CD than meets the eye - we'll also touch on the often-overlooked aspect of `Continuous Delivery`. Whether you're new to the concept or looking to brush up, this post will help you understand CI/CD in an easy-to-grasp way. Let's get started! 🌟

## 🤖 Continuous Integration (CI)

**Imagine a Library 📚:**

- Multiple authors (`developers`) write books (`code`) and submit them to the library (`repository`).
- A librarian (`CI tool`) collects all the books, checks for errors, and ensures they are properly formatted.
- If a book has errors, the librarian sends it back to the author for corrections.
- Once all books are error-free, the librarian creates a master copy (`build`) and stores it in the library.

**Key Takeaway:** `CI` ensures that individual code changes are integrated into a central repository, and automated processes verify that the code is correct and functional.

## 🚀 Continuous Deployment (CD)

**Imagine a Restaurant 🍽️:**

- Chefs (`developers`) prepare dishes (`code`) and pass them to the kitchen staff (`CD tool`).
- The kitchen staff checks the dishes for quality and presentation and then serves them directly to customers (`production`).
- If a dish is not up to standard, the kitchen staff sends it back to the chef for rework.
- Once a dish is approved, it's immediately served to customers.

**Key Takeaway:** `CD` automates the deployment of code changes to production, ensuring that only validated and tested code reaches the end-users.

## 🏭 Continuous Delivery (CD)

**Imagine a Factory 🏭:**

- Workers (`developers`) build components (`code`) and pass them to the quality control team (`CD tool`).
- The quality control team checks the components, assembles them into a final product, and packages it for delivery.
- The packaged product is then stored in a warehouse (`repository`) until it's ready to be shipped to customers (`production`).
- When the product is shipped, the factory receives feedback from customers, which is used to improve the production process.

**Key Takeaway:** `CD` ensures that code changes are built, tested, and packaged into a releasable product, which can be deployed to production at any time. It's a bridge between CI and CD.
